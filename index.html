inbetween the opening and closing html tag is going to be html code. The head is the part of the HTML file that
holds the information about the webpage and tells the browser how it should handle the page. Inside of the head

    <!-- This is the table element. Inside there are table rows (tr) which then house table data (td). Table data are the
    individual records within the table. You can also add in table headers (thead), table body (tbody), and table footers
    (tfoot). Inside the table head you add the names of the columns which are then formated by default to be bolded. th tags,
    which are like table data inside of a header, are used to create these cells. The reason that you have these cells Inside
    of the thead or tfoot is because it makes for simpler styling once you start with CSS. tbody contains all the table
